MazeClock watchface
==================

This is a custom watchface for the Pebble smart watch. [Download it][0].

It looks like this:

Although it may not be immediately apparent, there are 4 large numbers on this
face. It works by having a background of lines going one direction, while
another layer has lines in the other direction. The number digits change the
direction of the lines.

Thanks to [RichardG][2] for the assets. Based on the [Kisai Optical Illusion 
watch from TokyoFlash][1].

The only difference between this one and the one from RichardG is the position 
of the numbers (Centered) and their font. The lines are also thiker.

I did this to get some C experience, please be kind if there is some bugs.
